# Bluesquare hesabu manager

Is a dhis2 (react) app to manage a blsq hesabu project. It connects to the Hesabu api and allows you to manage your Hesabu from within DHIS2.

It will become the new frontend to the existing [Hesabu API](https://github.com/blsq/orbf2) project. While the [Hesabu API](https://github.com/blsq/orbf2) rails views are not going away, this will serve as more user friendly way to configure a Hesabu project.
